# CRUD Starter Frontend

![image](https://github.com/olinations/crud-starter-frontend/blob/master/template.png)

This is the React frontend that goes with the [CRUD Starter API backend](https://github.com/olinations/crud-starter-api). It can, however, be used as a starter for any app that features get, post, put and delete requests.

It uses Bootstrap styles and reactstrap, which creates Bootstrap components, to create a responsive data table that displays all data from a table in a database. It has a modal form for adding and editing items, a delete and edit button in each item row, and a button to download the entire database table into a CSV file.

It uses react-csv to create the CSV download button.
